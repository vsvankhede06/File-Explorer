Overview
This project is a simple file explorer application built using React.js. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating folders and files, similar to the sidebar functionality in VS Code.

Features 
Folder Creation: Users can easily create new folders in the file explorer by clicking on the "New Folder" button.

File Creation: Similarly, users can create new files by clicking on the "New File" button.

Interactive Sidebar: The file explorer's sidebar allows users to navigate through folders and view their contents. Clicking on a folder opens or closes it, providing a hierarchical view of the file structure.

Intuitive Interface: The application's design is inspired by VS Code's sidebar, making it familiar and easy to use.
